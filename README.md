# Bitwise-operators-in-CPP

## Aim
To study and implement bitwise operators in C++.

## Tools
C++ IDE / Visual Studio Code.

## Theory
Bitwise operators in C++ are used to perform bit-level operations on integral data types (like int, char, long, etc.). These operators treat values as sequences of bits (0s and 1s) rather than decimal or hexadecimal numbers.

The program takes two integers as input and performs the following bitwise operations:

AND (&)

OR (|)

XOR (^)

NOT (~)

Left Shift (<<)

Right Shift (>>)

How do these Bitwise Operators work :
1. '&' -	Bitwise AND -	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1.
2. ` -	Bitwise OR.
3. '^'	- Bitwise XOR - Sets each bit to 1 if only one of the bits is 1.
4. '~'	- Bitwise NOT -	Inverts all the bits (1 becomes 0, 0 becomes 1).
5. '<<'	- Left Shift	- Shifts bits to the left by a specified number of positions (adds 0s on the right).
6. '>>' - Right Shift	- Shifts bits to the right (drops bits from the right).



## Conclusion
Bitwise operators work on binary functions and we learnt how to implement them in C++.
